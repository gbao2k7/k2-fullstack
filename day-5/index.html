    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>This week I am extremely excited about cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerde the food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath thar is aprecisele set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking fir Geeks, Jeff Potter describes ir as "ultra-low temperature poaching".</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat ar the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
